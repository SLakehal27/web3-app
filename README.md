A Web3 app made for the MLH Web3 hackathon!

# Setup
1. We used ganache and solidity for deploying our smart contracts. To make these smart contracts work, you will need to setup ganache with the port number 7545. 

2. You will also need to setup a MetaMask account on your browser so that your browser may communicate with ganache (your MetaMask account will need to be imported through the ganache private key account). 

3. Finally, the solidity contract will have to be deployed using the truffle migrate command, and the built json abi file (User.json) will have to be copy and pasted inside the contracts.json file inside the client. 

4. Enjoy!
